      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p><i>
        This demo is an extended version of: 
        
        <ul>
          <li>Leon van Wissen, Chiara Latronico, Sandra van Ginhoven, Veruska Zamborlini (2020). The Montias Case: an experiment with data 
            reconciliation and provenance between research and cultural heritage institutions. In: <a class="external" href="https://dh2020.adho.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/137_TheMontiasCaseanexperimentwithdatareconciliationandprovenancebetweenresearchandculturalheritageinstitutions.html">Book of Abstracts DH2020</a>, ADHO. And the accompanying <a class="external" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7326555">code and data</a>.</li>
        </ul>
  
         New in this demo are:
        <ol>
          <li>Permalinks (URIs) to Persons and Locations from the Amsterdam City Archives index</li>
          <li>Annotations showing the output of the Golden Agents automatic object detection</li>
          <li>Links to the Bredius Notes of the RKD</li>
        </ol></i>
      </p>
    </span>

    <p>The demo shows shows the intersection of datasets on probate inventories from the <a href="https://www.goldenagents.org/" class="external">Golden
        Agents project</a> on top of a single archival book (NA 2408) from the <a
        href="https://archief.amsterdam/" class="external">Amsterdam City Archives</a>. The demo is built with Mirador
      version 3 and uses the iiif Presentation API version 3.0. The images that are shown are coming from a static
      source, but can be served by a iiif-server, serving the image API.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every Canvas in this manifest shows a scan of a double page spread of this archival book that is dated around 1648
      and contains mostly probate or estate inventories taken by a single notary. In these notarial deeds, the contents
      of a house are described, as part of a legal documentation of someones belongings and therefore possible
      inheritance. Every notarial deed in this book consists of one or multiple pages and therefore scans. This
      information is coming from the <b>(1) index on this book</b> that the Amsterdam City Archives provide, in which
      they already identified the type of deed, its date, the persons and locations that are mentioned, and the respective pages it is
      listed on. Secondly, separate from this, an <b>(2) HTR-output</b> is provided through the Transkribus tool, that
      gives the transcription of every text line it has automatically identified.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, on top of this, we have the transcriptions that were once made by economist and art-historian <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Michael_Montias" class="external">John Michael Montias</a>, who
      contributed his initial work to the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles and later continued his work at The
      Frick Collection in New York. Although sharing the same starting point, the two datasets he left behind at the
      respective institutes with provenance information on the probate inventories' owners and their belongings were
      each expanded, complemented, and corrected separately. Nowadays the data can be found in the <b>(3a) <a href="https://research.frick.org/montias" class="external">Frick
          Collection's Montias Database of 17th Century Dutch Art Inventories</a></b> and in the <b>(3b) <a
            href="https://piprod.getty.edu/starweb/pi/servlet.starweb?path=pi/pi.web" class="external">Getty Provenance
            Index</a></b>. Inventory
      descriptions from these datasets are connected to the index of the Amsterdam City Archive by matching on date and owners. The
      items identified in these datasets are connected to the HTR-annotations by matching on item transcription. The in
      the Golden Agents project developed tool <a
        href="http://2018.dhbenelux.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2018/05/Al-Idrissou-Chiara-Latronico_GoldenAgentsLenticularLenses_DHBenelux2018.pdf"
        class="external">Lenticular Lenses</a> was used for this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, and new in this demo, the <b>(4) <a href="https://www.goldenagents.org/" class="external">Golden Agents project</a></b> provides even more enrichments to this data, such as an automatic object detection on the textual material, as well as pointers to the notes of Abraham Bredius as kept in the <b>(5) <a href="https://rkd.nl/nl/projecten-en-publicaties/projecten/915-brediusaantekeningen" class="external">RKD Netherlands Institute for Art History</a></b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bringing these four datasets together gives a modern day digital humanities art historical scholar the right
      material to asses the validity of these transcriptions and the claims that were made on top of these descriptions.
      By directly going back to the archival material, it becomes immediately apparent that only a fraction of these
      inventories has been transcribed. Not only does this provide the necessary context for the item descriptions, it
      also highlights differences in spelling and classification, that are the result of changing interpretation
      strategies of the researchers working with this material.
    </p>

    <p>
      This demo shows the possibilities and the ease of working with archival material by transparently showing the
      resources from various content provides on top of each other.

    <h2>Demo</h2>
    <p>
      Annotations to items from the Getty and Frick datasets can be found on pp. 4-8, pp. 20-22, p. 33, pp. 216-217.
    </p>
    <p>
      N.B.: Using <a href="https://projectmirador.org/" class="external">Mirador v3.3</a>.
      Images served as static (image API level 0). You can try the
      <a href="https://lvanwissen.github.io/fricktalk-2023/iiif/manifest.json" class="external">manifest.json</a> in any
      viewer that supports annotations and the iiif Presentation API 3.0 (though you might need to fix the relative URIs
      in the manifest). Not all pages have been transcribed (through
      HTR), and not all listed record have an equal entry in the datasets of the Getty Provenance Index and the Frick's
      Montias Database. The line annotations highlighted in green include items from the Getty/Frick datasets. Matching
      of the items in the Getty and Frick datasets to a line annotation was done automatically and some links could
      therefore be missing or are wrongly matched. Due to the high number of annotations per Canvas, navigating the page
      can be slow.
    </p>

    <p>Click the eye icon ('Highlight all') in the annotation view to show all annotations on a page.</p>
