The demo shows the intersection of datasets the Golden Agents project (https://www.goldenagents.org/) is working with, as shown on top of a single archival book (NA 2408) from the Amsterdam City Archives (https://archief.amsterdam/). The demo is built with Mirador version 3 and uses the iiif Presentation API version 3.0. The images that are shown are coming from a static source, but can be served by a iiif-server, serving the image API.

## Data

Images are served through Image API level 0 (static) and are therefore shrunk to 75% quality. The full archive can be browsed at https://archief.amsterdam/5075/2408.

Other data is aggregated in the Golden Agents project (https://www.goldenagents.org/) and will be available in due time.
