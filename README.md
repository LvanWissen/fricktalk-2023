This demo is an updated and extended version of an earlier proof of concept. It shows shows the intersection of datasets on probate inventories from the Golden Agents project (https://www.goldenagents.org/) on top of a single archival book (NA 2408) from the Amsterdam City Archives (https://archief.amsterdam/). The demo is built with Mirador version 3 and uses the iiif Presentation API version 3.0. The images that are shown are coming from a static source, but can be served by a iiif-server, serving the image API.

New in this version is the addition of: 
1. URIs to Persons and Locations
2. Golden Agents object detection annotations (using [Analiticcl](https://github.com/proycon/analiticcl))
3. Pointers to the [Abraham Bredius Notes](https://github.com/knaw-huc/golden-agents-bredius/).
